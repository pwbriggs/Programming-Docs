# Overview

Wifi IP = 10.4.88.2 USB IP = 172.22.11.2 Time to actually get some code
onto a robot computer (a RoboRIO) instead of just running it on your
laptop. By the end of this, you will know how to deploy code onto the
Robox and potentially even one of our older competition robots!

If you only did the minimal computer setup at the start of the
curriculum, you may need to install the FRC Update Suite from [Full
Programming Onboarding](Programming-Onboarding "wikilink"). Check if you
have **FRC Driver Station** installed - if you don\'t have it, you will
need to install the FRC Update Suite.

# The Robox

The Robox is a \"robot-in-a-box\" that we built a few years ago and have
been using for all sorts of testing ever since.

1.  Get the Robox from the electronics closet (and/or find somebody who
    knows where the electronics closet is and what the Robox looks like)
2.  The robox comes with a power adapter. Plug one end into a
    traditional wall outlet, and the other into the red Anderson battery
    connector.
3.  Turn on the robox by closing the main breaker (if this is your first
    time, find somebody who knows how to do this)
4.  There should be a USB A to B cable, with the B end plugged into the
    [RoboRIO](Roborio "wikilink") (the large gray square). Plug the
    other end into your laptop
5.  On your laptop, press Win+R, then type cmd, and hit enter. When the
    command window appears, do the following:
    1.  Type, without the quotes: \"ping 172.22.11.2\"
    2.  Hit enter
    3.  If you see several lines like \"Reply from 172.22.11.2: bytes=32
        time\<1ms TTL=64\". Then things are good. If not, try using Wifi
6.  If the wired connection didn\'t work, or if you need to control the
    robot at a distance, then it\'s better to use wifi.
    1.  Change your wireless network to \"488_2018\" or something that
        looks like that. (All of our robot networks have 488 somewhere
        in their name).
    2.  On your laptop, press Win+R, then type cmd, and hit enter
    3.  Type, without the quotes: \"ping 10.4.88.2\"
    4.  Hit enter
    5.  If you see several lines like \"Reply from 10.4.88.2: bytes=32
        time\<1ms TTL=64\". Then things are good. If not, seek out a
        mentor or veteran for help.

# Getting code onto the Robox

## Starting Fresh

It\'s time to put some code on an actual RoboRIO, instead of just
running tests on your computer. We are going to use the FRCRobotTemplate
project, a stripped-down \"skeleton\" project that has just enough code
to boot up. Every year, we build the code for the competition robot
using this template.

1.  Create a new repository using our template as a base:
    <https://github.com/new?template_name=FRCRobotTemplate&template_owner=Team488>
2.  Clone your fork onto your computer
3.  Open the project in IntelliJ

## Getting a DriveSubsystem working

The FRCRobotTemplate already has a DriveSubsystem.java, and it
references the ElectricalContract class to determine which devices are
being used.

`<b>`{=html}⭐⭐ This section no longer matches the FRCRobotTemplate! We
now largely use a different type of drivetrain called Swerve Drive which
is not represented below. The descriptions below are still valid, but
they match a different kind of robot. The code in FRCRobotTemplate will
run on the Robox, and you can still practice deploying it.`</b>`{=html}

        @Inject
        public DriveSubsystem(XCANMotorControllerFactory mcFactory, XPropertyManager propManager, ElectricalContract contract, PIDManagerFactory pf) {
            log.info("Creating DriveSubsystem");

            this.leftLeader = mcFactory.create(contract.getLeftLeader());
            this.rightLeader = mcFactory.create(contract.getRightLeader());

            positionPid = pf.create(getPrefix() + "PositionPID");
            rotationPid = pf.create(getPrefix() + "RotationPID");
        }

On our robots, we typically have multiple implementations of the
ElectricalContract. You can think of each copy of the ElectricalContract
as a mapping for a specific robot. As an example, you might have a real
robot chassis with one device mapping, but the Robox might have
different mappings.

In this bot, CompetitionContract is the contract that is used when you
deploy to a robot or the Robox. The default contract assumes that there
are motors on channels 1 and 2.

        @Override
        public CANMotorControllerInfo getLeftLeader() {
            return new CANMotorControllerInfo(
                                "LeftLeader",
                                MotorControllerType.SparkMax,
                                CANBusId.RIO,
                                31,
                                new CANMotorControllerOutputConfig());
        }

        @Override
        public CANMotorControllerInfo getRightLeader() {
            return new CANMotorControllerInfo(
                                "RightLeader",
                                MotorControllerType.SparkMax,
                                CANBusId.RIO,
                                32,
                                new CANMotorControllerOutputConfig());
        }

  Your target, whether it\'s the Robox or a real robot, will likely have
different numbers. If you\'re using the Robox, the numbers are labeled
directly on the speed controllers. Choose any 2 speed controllers and
use their numbers instead of the default ones.

## Getting a command ready

The FRCRobotTemplate already has a TankDriveWithJoysticksCommand.java.
It assumes one gamepad - if you have more or different controllers, you
may need to modify code here.

If you\'re using the robox and don\'t have any controllers on hand, you
can modify the command to always drive forward at full speed.
(Obviously, this would be a very bad idea if you were using an actual
robot with wheels. Don\'t do that.)

This command is also considered the default command (check
SubsystemDefaultCommandMap.java), so it will automatically run when the
robot starts.

## Deploying code to the robot

At the top of the IntelliJ window, from the build target selector,
select \"Build & Deploy Robot\". Wait for the process to complete. Your
output window should look something like this:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 19s
    15 actionable tasks: 8 executed, 7 up-to-date

## Enabling the Robot

1.  Open the FRC Driver Station on your computer (should have already
    been installed during onboarding as part of the FRC Update Suite).
2.  Click the gear icon on the left side of your screen, in that screen
    make the team number \"488\".
3.  If you\'re using an actual robot, make sure your hand is hovering
    over the ENTER key. Pressing ENTER will disable the robot at
    anytime.
4.  Enable the robot, and observe what happens.
