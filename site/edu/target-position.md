Here we have an autonomous mode for the robot that requires it to drive
forward to a very specific position at the start of the match (into a
small scoring area). This is a very common challenge in FRC games. In
order to help with this, we have a distance sensor that you can read
that will tell you how far you\'ve traveled since the start of the
match.

This will be one of the first challenges that require you to write a
slightly more complicated command!

-   Command:
    /XbotEdu/src/main/java/competition/subsystems/drive/commands/DriveToPositionCommand.java
-   Unit test:
    /XbotEdu/src/test/java/xbot.edubot/linear/commands/DriveToPositionCommandTest.java

In order to get the current distance that your robot has traveled you
can do `pose.getPosition()` which uses the distanceSensor on the
`PoseSubsystem`. This sensor starts at 0 at the beginning of the match
and will track how far the robot has moved forwards/backwards in total.

**note**: It\'s important to understand the physical aspects of the
robot being programmed.

**note**: The robot keeps going even after the no more power is applied
to the motor (because of momentum)! To stop the robot: power must be
applied in reverse. This is a feature of the electric motors used in the
robot. If the robot had brakes these could be applied instead.

I suggest that you think through the problem yourself for a few minutes
and try some attempts on your own. After you\'ve experimented a bit,

## Graphical Tests! {#graphical_tests}

Unlike the earlier challenges, we have a nice visualizer that\'s easier
to read/understand than reading hundreds of log statements. With this
tool you can visualize the position of the virtual robot as your code is
running. The blue dot is where your robot is and the red dot is your
target.

To run it on IntelliJ, find the run target selector at the top of the
window and select LinearTestVisualizer. Click the green Run arrow next
to the drop-down menu.

When the window opens, you can use the slider on the right hand side to
control the simulation speed.

Once you have a solution that achieves the target position at all, the
next challenge is trying to do it as quickly as possible. Some of the
fastest solutions reach their goal in \~14 loops!

To help with tuning values and speeding things up, we\'ll introduce the
Property System next.

## The Property system {#the_property_system}

It\'s very common on the robot that we have numbers that we want to be
able to easily tune/tweak. For example:

-   How long should a robot wait after moving before scoring
-   How fast should the robot move
-   How fast should the shooter wheel spin to launch a ball

In these cases we never know what the right number is when we\'re first
writing our code, and then finding the right number will take a lot of
trial and error later on (either in the sim or on the real robot).
Instead of having to update the code, recompile and redeploy each time
we want to change a value, the Property system lets us do that while the
robot code is running live!

Here we\'ll learn how to create Properties and then you can choose to
use them in your commands if you want to.

Let\'s say I had a value that controlled the power of the robot relative
to how far away from it\'s goal it is. I\'ll call the value here \"p\".
To set this value up as a property we need to:

-   Add a new instance variable to your DriveToPositionCommand class of
    type DoubleProperty like this `DoubleProperty pProperty;`
-   Add a new parameter to the DriveToPositionCommand constructor
    function `PropertyFactory propertyFactory` (we\'ll learn more about
    the Factory pattern later!) that we\'ll use to create the property.
-   Inside the body of the constructor, call

\`\`\`java propertyFactory.setPrefix(this); pProperty =
propertyFactory.createPersistentProperty(\"p\", 1); \`\`\`

-   -   The second argument 1 in this case is the default value that the
        property should start with, make this whatever makes sense for
        your properties as you make them

-   Now when we want to read the value of this property in our code we
    can do that with `pProperty.get()`, if you don\'t have a good place
    to read this value already let\'s just print it out in the execute()
    so we can see it working `System.out.println(pProperty.get());`

Now let\'s try this out by simulating your robot like before, but now
we\'re also going to run another new program called **Elastic(WPILib)
2025**. Elastic is a program for viewing and setting these Property
values.

-   Inside Elastic you\'re going to click on \"Add Widget\" in the top
    bar.
-   Find your \"p\" value in the list under \"Preferences -\>
    DriveToPositionCommand -\> p\" and then drag the p value out onto
    the dashboard.

`<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2483d6fc-56ce-442a-a615-63073f85aed4">`{=html}

Now you can try changing your \`p\` value here and the robot code should
instantly read and use the new value! Once thats working, create
properties for any values you want to test and tweak in your commend.

## Running Commands from Elastic {#running_commands_from_elastic}

To test out your DriveToPositionCommand in the simulator we\'ve set
things up so you can run the command from Elastic. Do the same Add
Widget you did before but this time select SmartDashboard -\>
DriveToPosition and drag that out. You\'ll now see a button you can
press that will start/stop/restart your command in the simulator.

## Next steps {#next_steps}
